# UrlSplitting
split urls


## DESCRIPTION:

We all know URLs, http://www.meteogroup.com/en/gb/about-us/careers.html is a popular one.

Develop a class that decomposes a given URL into its constituents. For example, from the above url, we would like to get the result:

The protocol: "http"
The domain name: " www.meteogroup.com"
The path: “en/gb/about-us/careers.html”

Here are some example tests you could write to design this functionality:
"http://some.thing" should give protocol=="http"
"ftp://a.large.site" should give domain=="a.large.site"
"http://a.site.with/a-path" should give path=="a-path"

 
What other cases can you think of?
